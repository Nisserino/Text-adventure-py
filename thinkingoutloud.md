## Current thang
### Create a working game-loop

Initialize a char by creating a json object and placing all stats etc in it
when "starting" the game, the game should read the players json file
To start the gameplay it would want
- player name
- player position
- copleted quests (or something like position in campain)


### Later
- give exp for kills
- give bonus whatever for levelup



### Even later, later
- Inventory (Json?) append to json player file
