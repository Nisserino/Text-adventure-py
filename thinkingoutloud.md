## Map problems

How should I make my list? Can I keep the coordinates as some sort of notation?

And what info should be kept in the map_grid?

Use try exeptblock to not kill game on IndexError

How should I check if it's possible to move to another block?

Can I pass in a function as an argument in another function?
If possible, can I keep the while loop for inputs in the input checker function, or do I have to keep it in the function calling the input check?
